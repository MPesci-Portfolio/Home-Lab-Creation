# Home-Lab-Creation

## Objective

This project documents my first home lab build - a self-contained virtual ecosystem to gain hands-on experience in cybersecurity tooling and environments. This foundation helps me test configurations, simulate real-world threats and deepen my understanding in a risk-free space.

### Skills Learned

- Set up and managed virtualised environments using VirtualBox, including VM resource allocation and configuration.
- Designed and implemented an isolated virtual network (Host-Only) to simulate secure, real-world environments.
- Gained hands-on experience with Kali Linux and common security tools such as nmap for reconnaissance and service enumeration.
- Practiced identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in a deliberately vulnerable system (Metasploitable).
- Strengthened troubleshooting skills by verifying connectivity, resolving network issues, and capturing traffic with Wireshark.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
